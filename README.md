# data-safezone

Creating a comprehensive data leakage protection tool requires a detailed design and implementation, particularly when leveraging AI-driven analysis. Below is a simplified version of such a tool in Python. This version focuses on basic functionality, like detecting sensitive data patterns and preventing its leakage. Note that a production-level tool would require much more sophisticated techniques, including NLP models, integration with data sources, and more robust error handling. As per your request, I have added comments and basic error handling.

```python
import re
from typing import List

class DataSafeZone:
    def __init__(self):
        # Patterns for detecting sensitive data, such as credit card numbers and email addresses
        self.sensitive_patterns = [
            re.compile(r'\b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}\b'),  # Simple pattern for credit card numbers
            re.compile(r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+')        # Simple pattern for email addresses
        ]

    def is_sensitive(self, text: str) -> bool:
        """Check if the given text contains any sensitive information."""
        for pattern in self.sensitive_patterns:
            if pattern.search(text):
                return True
        return False

    def analyze_data(self, data: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        """Analyze a list of strings and return indices of those which contain sensitive information."""
        sensitive_indices = []
        for i, item in enumerate(data):
            if self.is_sensitive(item):
                print(f"SENSITIVE DATA DETECTED: Line {i + 1}: {item}")
                sensitive_indices.append(i)
        return sensitive_indices

    def shield_data(self, data: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        """Redact sensitive information in the given data."""
        redacted_data = []
        for i, item in enumerate(data):
            if self.is_sensitive(item):
                # Redact the entire line; more sophisticated techniques can be used for partial redaction
                redacted_data.append("[REDACTED]")
            else:
                redacted_data.append(item)
        return redacted_data


def main():
    try:
        example_data = [
            "Contact John at john.doe@example.com.",
            "Send the details to mr.smith@gmail.com.",
            "My credit card number is 1234 5678 9012 3456.",
            "This line has no sensitive data."
        ]
        
        data_safe_zone = DataSafeZone()
        print("Analyzing data for sensitive information...\n")
        sensitive_indices = data_safe_zone.analyze_data(example_data)
        
        if not sensitive_indices:
            print("No sensitive data detected.\n")
        else:
            print("\nRedacting sensitive information...\n")
            redacted_data = data_safe_zone.shield_data(example_data)
            for i, line in enumerate(redacted_data):
                print(f"Line {i + 1}: {line}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Notes:
- **Pattern Matching**: This example uses regular expressions to detect email addresses and credit card numbers. Real-world scenarios might require more complex detection mechanisms, such as machine learning models, especially for unstructured data like documents.
  
- **AI Integration**: Incorporating machine learning would require additional libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, transformers for NLP tasks) and pre-trained models or custom-trained models for more subtle patterns.

- **Redaction Strategy**: This example employs a simple redaction strategy. In practice, sensitive data might need partial redaction or other types of obfuscation.

- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented. Advanced error handling, logging, and potentially alerting mechanisms would be vital for production use.

Ensure you adhere to applicable data protection laws and best practices when implementing data protection tools.
